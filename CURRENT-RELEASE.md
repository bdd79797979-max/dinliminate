# CURRENT RELEASE — BUILD 1211 / CP1211

Date: 2026-10-07

## Restaurant Open filter

CP1211 simplifies the Restaurant hours control to one binary filter.

The Restaurant discovery rail is now:
**Search — Cuisine — Open**

**Open inactive** — all restaurants in the current pool. The word Open is crossed out.

**Open active** — only restaurants confirmed open now. The word Open is white and underlined.

Turning Open on uses the existing smart hours enrichment/cache. Turning it off does not run enrichment and returns to the full restaurant pool.

The All restaurant count therefore represents all restaurants when Open is off, and only confirmed-open restaurants when Open is on.

Legacy saved Closed Now state is normalized to All.

## Recovery

CP1210 remains the functional baseline for this change. CP1211 is a UI/behavior simplification on top of the existing Open Now enrichment system. No production deployment was made.
